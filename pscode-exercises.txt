// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers
//Answer:

START
  PRINT "Enter the first number: "
  READ num1
  PRINT "Enter the second number: "
  READ num2
  sum = num1 + num2
  PRINT "The sum of the two numbers is: " + sum
END
//Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
START
  PRINT "Enter a number: "
  READ number
  IF number MOD 2 == 0 THEN
    PRINT "The number is even."
  ELSE
    PRINT "The number is odd."
END
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
//Answer:
START
  PRINT "Enter the first number: "
  READ num1
  PRINT "Enter the second number: "
  READ num2
  PRINT "Enter the third number: "
  READ num3
  PRINT "Enter the fourth number: "
  READ num4
  PRINT "Enter the fifth number: "
  READ num5

  sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
  average = sum / 5

  min = num1
  IF num2 < min THEN min = num2
  ESLSE IF num3 < min THEN min = num3
  ESLSE IF num4 < min THEN min = num4
  ESLSE IF num5 < min THEN min = num5

  max = num1
  IF num2 > max THEN max = num2
  ESLSE IF num3 > max THEN max = num3
  ESLSE IF num4 > max THEN max = num4
  ESLSE IF num5 > max THEN max = num5

  PRINT "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
  PRINT "The smallest of the five numbers is: " + min
  PRINT "The largest of the five numbers is: " + max
